"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page","Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","Mandell Creighton (1843–1901) was a British historian and clergyman. He studied at the University of Oxford, then became a don in 1866. He was appointed the first occupant of the Dixie Chair of Ecclesiastical History at the University of Cambridge in 1884. The following year, he also was engaged as the founding editor of The English Historical Review, the first English-language academic journal in its field. In these posts, he helped to establish history as an independent academic discipline in England. Creighton was a parish priest of the Church of England who rose to be Bishop of London from 1897 and, but for his death, was thought likely to become Archbishop of Canterbury. His moderation and practicality drew praise from Queen Victoria. He was firm in asserting that public figures should be judged for their public acts, not private ones. He believed that the Church of England was uniquely shaped by its particular English circumstances, and he saw it as the soul of the nation. (Full article...)"

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting","Cross-site scripting - Wikipedia","Cross-site scripting (XSS)[a] is a type of security vulnerability that can be found in some web applications. XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy. XSS effects vary in range from petty nuisance to significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's owner network."

He studied at the University of Oxford, then became a don in 1866. He was appointed the first occupant of the Dixie Chair of Ecclesiastical History at the University of Cambridge in 1884. The following year, he also was engaged as the founding editor of The English Historical Review, the first English-language academic journal in its field. In these posts, he helped to establish history as an independent academic discipline in England. Creighton was a parish priest of the Church of England who rose to be Bishop of London from 1897 and, but for his death, was thought likely to become Archbishop of Canterbury. His moderation and practicality drew praise from Queen Victoria. He was firm in asserting that public figures should be judged for their public acts, not private ones. He believed that the Church of England was uniquely shaped by its particular English circumstances, and he saw it as the soul of the nation. (Full article...)"

There are around 12,500 Church of England parishes.[2] Historically, in England and Wales, the parish was the principal unit of local administration for both church and civil purposes; that changed in the 19th century when separate civil parishes were established.

Sutradara sekaligus produser film Darah dan Doa adalah Usmar Ismail. Film ini berkisah tentang Divisi Siliwangi yang dipimpin Kapten Sudarto ketika berhijrah menuju Jawa Barat. Film Darah dan Doa seringkali disebut sebagai film buatan Indonesia yang pertama setelah film Tjitra (1949) karya Umar Ismail yang dibuat oleh perusahaan Belanda. Pengambilan gambar perdana untuk film Darah dan Doa dilakukan pada tanggal 30 Maret 1950 dan ditetapkan sebagai hari film nasional di Indonesia. Film Darah dan Doa awalnya diproduksi untuk ditayangkan di Festival Film Cannes dengan biaya produksi sejumlah Rp350.000. Proses produksi Darah dan Doa nyaris berhenti karena kesulitan keuangan sebelum sang sutradara mendapatkan kucuran dana tambahan. Begitu rilis, film ini disensor akibat isinya yang menimbulkan kontroversi. Penayangannya berakhir dengan kegagalan dari segi komersial. Meski begitu, film ini ditanggapi dengan lebih positif dalam ulasan-ulasan di kemudian hari, hingga Ismail pun digelari sebagai ""bapak film Indonesia"". (Selengkapnya...)"
