Major populations occur around South America, southwestern Africa, New Zealand, and several oceanic islands. It has a somewhat stocky body with a short beak, a curved dorsal fin and flippers, and a multi-coloured pigmentation of black, grey, and white. The species prefers cool currents and inshore waters. It lives in a fission–fusion society where groups change size based on social and environmental conditions. The dolphin feeds on several fish and squid species, sometimes using daytime bait ball herding and nightime feeding in deep scattering layers. Mating is polygynandrous – several males will chase after a single female. Young are raised by females in nursery groups. The dusky dolphin is known for its acrobatics, displaying leaping behaviours. It is a popular tourist attraction and the object of whale watching tours. (Full article...)"

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page","Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","The dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) is a small oceanic dolphin found in coastal waters of the Southern Hemisphere. Major populations occur around South America, southwestern Africa, New Zealand, and several oceanic islands. It has a somewhat stocky body with a short beak, a curved dorsal fin and flippers, and a multi-coloured pigmentation of black, grey, and white. The species prefers cool currents and inshore waters. It lives in a fission–fusion society where groups change size based on social and environmental conditions. The dolphin feeds on several fish and squid species, sometimes using daytime bait ball herding and nightime feeding in deep scattering layers. Mating is polygynandrous – several males will chase after a single female. Young are raised by females in nursery groups. The dusky dolphin is known for its acrobatics, displaying leaping behaviours. It is a popular tourist attraction and the object of whale watching tours. (Full article...)"

It has a somewhat stocky body with a short beak, a curved dorsal fin and flippers, and a multi-coloured pigmentation of black, grey, and white. The species prefers cool currents and inshore waters.
